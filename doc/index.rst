An Elusive Bug
========================



A Tournament to Slay the Elusive Bug
========================
Esteemed developers, hear me now as I beckon forth the valiant souls who dare to tread the hallowed grounds of our digital frontier! A challenge of unparalleled magnitude has befallen us, a bug so cunning, so elusive, that it eludes the grasp of our noble endeavors.

Behold, a foe entrenched within the shadows of our code, wherefrom the depths of local scopes, it thwarts our every attempt at vanquishment! Yes, my comrades, within the annals of our sacred repositories lies the elusive bug, residing in the enigmatic chambers of "test_nested_reimport_with_modification/test_class_reimport_local.py" and its kin, evading even the most astute of seekers.

Noble digital craftsmen, in our quest to vanquish the elusive bug, it is imperative to acknowledge that while this foe remains undefeated, it has been contained within its current form. Fear not, for there exists a strategy to navigate around its treacherous grip unscathed. By heeding the wisdom of importing in the global scope or employing import without the use of 'from', we can gracefully sidestep the clutches of this formidable adversary.

Yet, let us not only seek triumph for the sake of our own glory, but also in the spirit of camaraderie and shared achievement. As a testament to this, I extend an offer of contribution to our repository, and pledge to immortalize the valiant souls who emerge victorious in this battle. Among the authors of our repository, there shall stand proudly the name of the first to slay the beast, their triumph immortalized for posterity.

Therefore, let every keystroke resonate with the fervor of our collective determination, as we forge ahead with unwavering resolve. Together, as a fellowship of code warriors, we shall prevail in this epic tournament to conquer the indomitable bug!
